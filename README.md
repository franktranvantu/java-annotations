# Finishing the Annotation - Targets and Elements

During this section we will continue writing our annotation, first by specifying the targets. 

These configure which Java components can be "decorated" with our annotation, for example classes, methods, fields, etc. 

We'll wrap up the annotation by defining elements or attributes. Think of these elements as instance fields for the Java component that's been annotated.
