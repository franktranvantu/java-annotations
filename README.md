# Introduction to Reflection

We take one more sidestep during this course, this time to what's called reflection. 

Reflection is a programming technique that allows us to examine (and even modify) the structure of objects at run-time. 

During this section, we'll practice some basic reflection so that we can utilize these techniques to check for the presence of our @Doc annotation.
